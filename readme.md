# Custom Oblivion Reloaded Shaders

These are mostly the same shaders that come with Oblivion Reloaded with a few customizations for myself, mostly in the HDR shader.

A makefile and DirectX compiler are hosted to help with compiling HLSL shaders on Linux, otherwise they should compile fine through Oblivion Reloaded on Windows as well.
Oh and you shouldn't need to compile the shaders, I just commit them already compiled here directly for convenience.

I have not provided a license because I do not have copyright over the shaders from OR nor over the DirectX compiler, they are merely here for convenience.

Otherwise, feel free to use my code as reference free of copyright.
